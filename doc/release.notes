v1
Major re-write.  Brings in some code from the ACD.  Uses polynomials to
smooth pha distributions and find the peak values.  Uses a simple algorithm
to decide what range to fit over.  Supports both ped-subrtracted and raw values.

v0

Assuming all ACD tiles are installed around full LAT, the code uses 
reconstructed muon direction to correct energy deposited in the ACD tiles.
Note the code assumes the data is NOT zero suppressed, it also assumes 
pedestal lies between 0 and 400 ACD counts.
